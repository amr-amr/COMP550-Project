## Abstract
The use of syntactic information has been found to improve performance on different nat-ural language processing (NLP) tasks. How-ever, there are limited and conflicting findings on this topic in the context of deep learning for sentiment analysis. We propose a strategy to encode parse tree and part-of-speech infor-mation to augment word embeddings; and evaluate it on the large movie review dataset. Our results indicate that this syntactic infor-mation does not increase performance. Poten-tial reasons include existing encoding of syn-tactic information in neural networks and word embeddings, as well as limitations with our ex-periment.
