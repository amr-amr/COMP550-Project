We will cover everything you need to know to get started with NLP using deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow. We will cover the common best practices, functionalities, and steps you need to understand the basics of TensorFlow APIs to build powerful predictive models via the computation graph. In the process of building our models, we will compare PyTorch and TensorFlow to let the learner appreciate the strenghts of each tool.\n",

    "## 1. Deep Learning Frameworks\n",
    "There are many deep learning frameworks such as Chainer, DyNet, MXNet, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras. Each framework has their own strenghts which a researcher or a developer may want to consider before choosing the right framework. In my opinion, PyTorch is great for researchers and offers eager execution by default, but its high-level APIs require some understanding of deep learning concepts such as **affine layers** and **automatic differentiation**. On the other hand, TensorFlow was originally built as a low-level API that provides a robust list of functionalities to build deep learning models from the ground up. More recently, TensorFlow also offers **eager execution** and is equipped with a high-level API known as Keras.\n",

    "You have learned how to perform neural-based emotion recognition using RNNs. There are many things you can do after you have completed this tutorial. You can attempt the exercises outlined in the \"Outline\" section of this notebook. You can also try other types of neural architectures such as LSTMs, Bi-LSTMS, attentions models, and CNNs. In addition, you can also store the models and conduct transfer learning to other emotion-related tasks. \n"
